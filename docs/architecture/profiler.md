# Hardware Profiler

Components
- Static analysis: FLOPs, memory footprints, roofline placement.
- Dynamic profiling: instrumentation, sampling, hardware counters.
- Simulation: analytical and trace-based options.

Outputs
- Latency, throughput, memory usage, and energy estimates.
- Traces for visualization (timeline, flame graphs).

Integration
- Profiling hooks at graph and kernel levels.
- Consistent metrics schema for the auto-tuner and dashboard.
